# Husky ComputerVision-Repository

This repository will cover the treatment of videos involving computer vision. The project was developed to carry out an Estimation for Mobile Robotics, applying the concepts that were developed in the Computer Vision course, bringing up the concepts of:

- Color Histograms
- Edges
- Monadic Processes
- Dyadic Operations
- Kernels
- Image Color Treatment
- Color Grading
- Image Moment and Centroid

Below, you can quantitatively analyze the result of Husky's movement for the first motivational video, where the angle graph and the robot's trajectory stand out. You can see these and other examples in the files available in this repository: in the Main, Images and Videos folders.
